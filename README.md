# Why estimate salaries?

Focusing on the product, we would want to predict house prices to give a consumer a better idea of what a home would cost. If a consumer knows the prices of a desireable home, this can help financial planning needed to make a purchase. The sale price of a home in this dataset may not match the final purchase price in real life. Predicting home prices will offer a starting price point for the consumer to consider.

This project aims to give a purchaser an estimate of what a home will cost. This project's final product will be a predictive model trained on a set of house features.
